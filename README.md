# PDF
parse info from pdf.

The purpose of this macro is to be able to copy data from a pdf report and paste it into cell A1. 
The macro will do the rest and result in a standard data table. This doesnt actually pull the data from the PDF but instead, you will copy data from the PDF and paste in Excel.  
It is more of a simple text parser.
